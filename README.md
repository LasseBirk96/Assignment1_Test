## REFLECTIONS
**1. SHOOTING**\
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible reasons for the man not dying. 

There can be an infinite amount of reasons as to why the man does not die. To make mention of controllability, if we could create a specific state and run a simulation of a person firing a shot with a gun at another person, we could narrow the possibilities down, however at first glance it seems impossible to test and thereby record the amount of reasons as to why the man does not die. But, if i had to make list of some examples:

The woman simply misses.
The man is wearing protective gear.
The gun is actually a prop gun that fires blanks.
The man catches the bullet with his teeth.
The woman is a schizophrenic and there is no man.
The gun was fired during the summer of 2073, where it is so hot that the bullet evaporates the second it is fired.



**2. ALIEN**\
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise).


1. Assume that it has a toothbrush and toothpaste
2. Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise and push the toothpaste out of the tube by applying pressure with your hand, so that the toothpaste lands on the "brushhead" of the toothbrush.
3. Open your mouth.
4. Rotate the toothbrush so that the toothpaste bit is facing your teeth.
5. Place the toothbrush on your teeth.
6. Apply slight pressure and move the toothbrush in a circular motion on your teeth.
7. Continue this until all edges feel clean.
8. Spit put toothpaste
9. Fin

When i input degrees in celcius\
i get an output of degrees in fahrenheit

**2. ROMAN NUMERAL KATA**\
Given that I wish to convert arabic numerals to roman numerals\
When I input an arabic number\
I get an output that is converted to roman numerals



## GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON BDD

**What was positive and good about using BDD?** \
That it makes a lot of sense to write specifications in a language that everyone can understand. It makes the requirements more clear and leaves less room for misinterpretation.

**What was annoying or difficult?** \
I can see the appeal of using BDD, but not in such a small case as this exercise requires. It led to overthinking most of the time. Had it been a major feature, i could see myself using BDD as intended, but on such a small scale, it seemed a bit unnecessary.

**What surprised you?** \
That there are multiple definitions of BDD. I am a little unsure whether I completely understand it, because in some cases it's very straight forward, and in others it's very complicated.

**Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more?** \
In the context of this exercise, no. But I worked with BDD during my internship, and it helped massively then.

**Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought of?**  \
I don't think so.
